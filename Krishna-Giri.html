    <h2>About Our School</h2>
    <p>Education is an essential part of our lives. We are nothing without knowledge, and education is what separates us from others. The main step to acquiring education is enrolling oneself in a school. School serves as the first learning place for most of the people. Similarly, it is the first spark in receiving an education. In this essay on my school, I will tell you why I love my school and what my school has taught me.</p>
    <p> We have all been to school and we have loved each and every moment we have spent over there as those were the building blocks of our lives. A school is a place where students are taught the fundamentals of life, as well as how to grow and survive in life. It instils in us values and principles that serve as the foundation for a child’s development.</p>
    <P>My school is my second home where I spend most of my time. Above all, it gives me a platform to do better in life and also builds my personality. I feel blessed to study in one of the most prestigious and esteemed schools in the city. In addition, my school has a lot of assets which makes me feel fortunate to be a part of it. Let us look at the essay on my school written below.</p></fieldset>

    <h2>About Dashain Festival</h2>
    <p>Dashain, also known as Vijaya Dashami, is the greatest and most widely celebrated Hindu festival in Nepal. It typically falls in September or October (depending on the lunar Bikram Sambat calendar) and lasts 15 days. Dashain is much more than a festival.</p>
    <p>It brings Nepalis in Nepal and abroad together and provides a sense of unity. For this reason, the importance of Dashain has gone up at a time when disunity and fractured relations have become much more common. In addition to Nepal, Hindus in India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh celebrate Dashain. </p>

    <h2>About ID Festival</h2>
    <p>The festival of Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, is celebrated all over the world. Muslims observe Ramadan by reading the Qur’an, emphasizing charity (zakat), abstaining from food and drink during daylight hours, and concentrating on prayer and study to increase their taqwa, or sacred consciousness. Observation of Ramadan is one of the five pillars of Islam.</p>
    <p>Eid al-Fitr, often shortened to “Eid,” is a joyous celebration traditionally lasting three days. Muslims mark the occasion with private and community events such as communal prayer (salat), parties, preparing and eating special foods, giving gifts, wearing new clothes, and visiting friends and family. A few days before Eid al-Fitr, Muslims make donations of food to the poor—sadaqah al-fitr (charity of fast-breaking)—so that all may mark the end of fasting with a special meal for the holiday.</p>

    <h2>About Tihar and Chhat Festival</h2>
    <p>Tihar and Chhat are two vibrant festivals celebrated in Nepal and some parts of India, steeped in tradition and cultural significance. Tihar, also known as Deepawali, is a five-day festival of lights that falls in late October or early November. Chhat, on the other hand, is a four-day festival dedicated to the Sun god Surya and Chhathi Maiyya, the goddess associated with fasting and purity, observed around six days after Tihar.</p>
    <p>Here's a glimpse into the unique traditions of each festival:</p>
    <h3>Tihar</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Day 1 (Kag Tihar):</b> This day honors crows, believed to be messengers of Yama, the god of death. Offerings of sweets and grains are made to appease them.</li>
      <li><b>Day 2 (Kukur Tihar):</b> The second day is dedicated to dogs, considered loyal companions and protectors. They are adorned with marigolds and offered delicious food.</li>
      <li><b>Day 3 (Gai Tihar):</b> Cows are worshipped on this day as a symbol of prosperity and motherhood. They are decorated with colorful fabrics and offered puja (prayers).</li>
      <li><b>Day 4 (Govardhan Puja & Diwali):</b> The fourth day coincides with Diwali, the festival of lights. Homes are illuminated with diyas (oil lamps), symbolizing the victory of good over evil. Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, is also worshipped on this day.</li>
      <li><b>Day 5 (Bhai Tika):</b> The final day celebrates the bond between siblings. Sisters apply tikas (colorful paste) on their brothers' foreheads, wishing them well-being and prosperity.</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Chhat</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Day 1 (Nahay Khaay):</b> On the first day, devotees take a holy bath in a river or pond and observe a strict vegetarian diet.</li>
      <li><b>Day 2 ( Kharna):</b> The second day involves preparing prasad (ritualistic food offerings) of thekua (deep-fried wheat flour dough) and kheer (rice pudding).</li>
      <li><b>Day 3 (Sandhya Arghya):</b> This is the most significant day where devotees offer prayers and offerings to the setting sun at a riverbank or any natural water source.</li>
      <li><b>Day 4 (Usha Arghya):</b> Chhat concludes with offerings to the rising sun, symbolizing gratitude and the completion of the rituals.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Both Tihar and Chhat are vibrant celebrations that strengthen social bonds and express reverence for nature and the divine.</p>
